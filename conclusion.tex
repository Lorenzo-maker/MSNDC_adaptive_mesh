\section*{Conclusions}
A $\pnh$ mesh refinement method for numerical optimal control has been developed. The associated {\bf Algorithms~\ref{alg:step1} and~\ref{alg:step2}} detail an innovative approach where the degrees of the polynomials approximating the solution of an OCP can assume distinct values for each state vector component and for each finite element.

The examples discussed highlight the advantages of this approach in producing a final refined mesh which, while coping with the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$, allows a sensible reduction of the overall number of variables in the NLP, thus reducing the computational burden.

These advantages are more pronounced for systems with larger number of states, as shown in Example 2 and 3.
Furthermore, the solutions difference between our new method and the one proposed in~\cite{Patterson:OCAM:2015} are, at least in our numerical experiments, six order of magnitude smaller than any state or control values. This means that the classical more conservative approach, where each state always follows the ``worst'' state in terms of $p$-refinement, has no practical advantage.
